# THIS IS NOT A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR YOUR OWN NIXOS SETUPS

# NixOS configurations for:
- My personal machine
- NAS File/Media server
- PCs of non tech savvy relatives

# TODO
[ ] Learn Nix properly and refactor everything :D
[ ] Proper secrets management.
[ ] Look into Cachix.
[ ] Dev shell templates.
[ ] Look into a way to remove user account names from the configuration.
